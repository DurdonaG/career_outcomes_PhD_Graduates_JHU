# Career Outcomes of Life Science PhD Graduates 2003-2020 analysed by sector 

## Background 

Usually completeng a PhD is a last step in student's educational pathway and first step for establishing their careers or growing an established career. Not every PhD student continues on in academia. People with PhDs are needed at different places in society, and their academic skills prepare them for a wide array of challenges. 
Coalition for the Next Generation Life Science is a foundation that brings trancparency to PhD and postdoctoral training in order to empower and inform training for the next generation of scientists around the world. They are commited to create trancparency for a stronger workforce.  
Johns Hopkins is a founding member of CNGLS whose members are jointly committed to increased transparency related to doctoral and postdoctoral training in the life sciences. The links below lead to doctoral program statistics and information about postdoctoral statistics.

The source contains career outcomes of PhD graduates by job type and job sector. 

## Business Question

Why majority of PhD students prefer certain field more over another and how this has changed over the past ten years?

## Data Question 

What sectors/ job types were chosen by PhD graduates and which sector has most of the graduates according to cluster analysis? How this has changed over the past few years?

## Analysis 

Data from Coalition for the Next Generation Life Science was obtained, cleaned and examined. In the following table you can see how different majors in life sciences such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Biological Chemistry, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and etc. have chosen different patways by sector such as: Academia, For-Profit, Government, Nonprofit; and by job type: Further training or education, Primarily research, Primarily teaching, Science-related, Not related to science as can be seen in the following table:

# Cluster Analysis by Sector Upon Graduation #

First analysis performed is a cluster analysis by job sector right upon graduation. As can be seen in the cluster analysis outcome, standarized cluster anchors are 21, 23, and 4. Negative standard deviation here indicates the anchor is below the mean and positive standard deviation indicate being placed above the mean.

In the following scatterplot, clusters can be seen:

# Cluster Analysis by Job Type Upon Graduation #

Next analysis is a cluster analysis by job type upon graduation. Cluster anchors here are 9, 17, and 22: Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Epidomology, and Immunology.

After running multiple iterations, we now have the output to graph and summarize the data. Here is the output graph for this cluster analysis. Following scater plot demonstrates clusters more clearly:

## Conclusion 

To conclude, upon graduation, most of the students were inclided towards Human Genetics and Molecular Biology sector and sectors that have similarities to that. When it comes to the job type, upon graduation, immunology and jobs with similar metrics were more popular among recent PhD graduates. For the future research, it would be interesting to look at how this trend has changed over the years and whether students retain the same position after 10 years of graduation as the one they had right upon graduation. It would also be interesting to look at what factors play a role for students to pick particular job type or a job sector.
